# Assignment

Hmmm, `includes`. That sounds familiar.

Write a function `includes(xs, ys)` that checks if all elements of `ys` also appear in `xs`,
but now with a list comprehension!

Hint: `all(bs)` is a built-in function that checks if all values in `bs` are true.
For example:

```python
all([n >= 0 for n in ns])
```

checks if all values in `ns` are positive.
