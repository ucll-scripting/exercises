# Assignment

Write a function `includes(xs, ys)` that checks if all elements of `ys` also appear in `xs`.

You will probably need to check whether some value `x` appears in some list `xs`.
This is basic functionality, which generally means that there exists
a built-in function for. Make sure to look it up and make use of it.
