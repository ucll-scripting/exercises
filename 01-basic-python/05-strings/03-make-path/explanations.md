# Assignment

Write a function `make_path(parts)` that, given an array of strings,
builds a path out of them by joining them together in one large string,
separated by slashes.

For example, say `parts = ['a', 'b', 'c']`, `make_path(parts)`
should then return `'a/b/c'`.

As always, try to find built-in functionality that does most
of the work for you. Hint: look for `join` in the
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str).
